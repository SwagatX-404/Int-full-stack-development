1.What's the difference between `block`, `inline`, and `inline-block`?

 	- Block : Takes the full width and Always starts on new line.
 			set width, height, margin, padding .
 			ex: <div>, <h1>, <p>
 
 	-Inline : Takes only as much width as needed and stays in line with other elements.
 			Does not start on a new line.
 			we can not set width or height
 			ex: <a>, <span>, <strong>

 	-Inline-Block : Acts like inline but allows block properties like set width, height, margin, padding
 			ex: <img>, <button>
 
2.Are you familiar with styling SVG?

    - SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is an image format for displaying vector graphics 
    — it uses XML-based markup to draw shapes (like circles, lines, paths, etc.) 
    - that scale without losing quality.

    ex- //index.html
         <svg width="100" height="100">
               <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40" />
         </svg>

         //styeles.css
           svg circle {
                        fill: skyblue;
                        stroke: navy;
                        stroke-width: 2;
                    }
