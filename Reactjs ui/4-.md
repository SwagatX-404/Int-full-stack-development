Downloading Libraries for React in existing web application

1. Open terminal and run the commands
    >npm install react@18 react-dom@18   --save
    >npm install @bable/standalone --save

2. Libraries are copied into "node_modules" 

3. We have to link the suitable module for our apllication

4. React 18 provides CJS and UMD module systems.
      CJS - Common JS
      UMD - Universal Module Distribution

5. NPM default enable with UMD in our project hence link the libraries from UMD.

    <script src="../node_modules/react/umd/react.development.js"> </script>
    <script src="../node_modules/react-dom/umd/react-dom.development.js">  </script>
    <script src="../node_modules/@babel/standalone/babel.js"> </script>

    # ðŸ”¹ Difference Between Single Call and Singleton in JavaScript

## ðŸ“Œ 1. Single Call - every request is created new object
- A function that executes **every time it is called**.  
- No state is preserved between calls.  
- Each call is **independent**.  

### âœ… Example:
```js
function greet() {
  console.log("Hello, Swagat!");
}

greet(); // "Hello, Swagat!"
greet(); // "Hello, Swagat!" again (new execution)


## ðŸ“Œ 2. Singleton - object is created for first request and the same object will be used across any no. of request. thiis mechanism is called singleton.

A design pattern that ensures only one instance of an object exists.

The same instance is reused across the app.

Useful for: Database connection, Logger, Config manager.
